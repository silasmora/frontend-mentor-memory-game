- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Resuable Button Components:
Using reuseable component was a game changer. But knowing how to use them effectively was also a good learning curve for me. Make sure that every prop that's unique to where you're passing that reusable button is actually provided.

Dynamic Styling with Tailwind CSS:
Styled components dynamically using Tailwind CSS classes, creating responsive and visually appealing UI elements and pseudo classes on.

Array Manipulation:
Utilized and re-enforced array methods like sort, filter, and reduce to manage and manipulate player data, finding winners, and handling ties.

Game Logic and Rules:
Designed and implemented the game logic, including finding pairs, tracking scores, determining winners, and handling ties.
